## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a **Knowledge-Base Search Engine** using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**. The system allows users to upload documents (TXT / PDF), ask natural language questions, and receive accurate, document-grounded answers generated by a Large Language Model (LLM).

The core idea is to retrieve relevant document content using **embeddings** and then synthesize answers using an **LLM**, instead of relying solely on the model’s internal knowledge.

### 🎯 Objective
* Enable search and question answering over user-provided documents.
* Reduce hallucinations by grounding answers in document content.
* Demonstrate a complete RAG pipeline with backend APIs.
* Handle real-world document ingestion challenges (e.g., PDF parsing).

### 🧠 What is RAG?
**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** combines:
1.  **Information Retrieval:** Finding relevant document chunks.
2.  **Language Generation:** Generating answers using an LLM with the retrieved context.

**Benefits:**
* ✅ Accuracy
* ✅ Reliability
* ✅ Explainability
* ✅ Up-to-date knowledge

## 🔍 How the System Works (Step by Step)

### 1️⃣ Document Ingestion

* User uploads a document.
* Text is extracted, cleaned, and validated.
* Content is split into manageable chunks.
* Each chunk is converted into an embedding using **Gemini**.

### 2️⃣ Vector Storage

* Embeddings are stored in an **in-memory vector store**.
* Structure: `{ text, embedding }`.

### 3️⃣ Query Processing

* User query is converted into an embedding (**Gemini**).
* **Cosine similarity** is used to find the most relevant chunks from the store.

### 4️⃣ Answer Generation

* The Top-K relevant chunks are passed as context.
* **Groq LLM** generates an answer strictly based on the provided context.

## 🤖 Why Gemini + Groq?

### 🔹 Gemini (Embeddings)

* **Free tier available.**
* High-quality semantic embeddings.
* Ideal for retrieval tasks.

### 🔹 Groq (Generation)

* **Free and extremely fast.**
* Stable OpenAI-compatible API.
* Avoids Gemini SDK instability for text generation tasks.

> The RAG architecture is provider-agnostic, meaning you can swap models without breaking the system design.

## 🚧 Challenges Faced & Solutions

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **PDF Text Extraction Issues** | Font-encoded or encrypted PDFs returning binary garbage. | Implemented strong text cleaning and validation to reject bad PDFs. |
| **Gemini Model Errors (404)** | SDK version & API instability for generation. | Switched to **Groq** for text generation while keeping Gemini for embeddings. |
| **Slow Ingestion Time** | Large PDFs caused sequential embedding calls. | Limited chunk count for the demo and explained it as an offline step. |
| **Data Loss on Restart** | In-memory storage resets on server stop. | Documented the limitation; suggested **FAISS, ChromaDB, or MongoDB Atlas** for production. |

## 📄 PDF Support (Important Note)

> ⚠️ **This system supports text-based PDFs only.**

| **Supported** ✔️ | **Not Supported** ❌ |
| --- | --- |
| LibreOffice PDFs | Scanned PDFs |
| Research Papers | Image-only PDFs |
| Word-exported PDFs | Font-encoded PDFs (e.g., some Canva exports) |

*Note: OCR integration is required to support scanned documents.*

## ▶️ How to Run Locally

### 1️⃣ Clone Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/knowledge-base-rag.git](https://github.com/your-username/knowledge-base-rag.git)
cd knowledge-base-rag

```

### 2️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install

```

### 3️⃣ Setup Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_key
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key

```

### 4️⃣ Start Server

```bash
node backend/server.js

```

The server will run on: `http://localhost:3000`

## 🧪 Demo Flow

1. Upload a **TXT** or **text-based PDF**.
2. Wait for the ingestion success message.
3. Ask a question about the document.
4. Receive a grounded answer! 🚀
